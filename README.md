# julia-interpreter

This was an assignemnt for my Concepts of Programming Languages class. 

It was split into three sprints which were the scanner, parser, and interpreter. 

I learned a lot about how languages can be broken down with lexing and parsing through this specific project. It taught me how languages are structured. Here are the results of my test cases also found in the docx files. The second test case was supposed to be unable to parse due to an intentional error in the test case.
